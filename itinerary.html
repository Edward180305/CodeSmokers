                        Start your trip with a visit to McLeod Ganj, the Tibetan heart of Dharamshala. Known as "Little Lhasa," this vibrant town offers the perfect blend of Tibetan culture and serene natural beauty. Visit the Dalai Lama Temple, walk through bustling markets selling Tibetan handicrafts, and enjoy delicious Tibetan cuisine at one of the many local cafes. McLeod Ganj is also home to several Tibetan monasteries, perfect for a moment of tranquility.

The trek takes about 4-6 hours to reach the top, offering panoramic views of the Dhauladhar mountain range and the Kangra valley below. The summit, standing at an altitude of 2,827 meters, provides spectacular views, perfect for both sunrise and sunset. Feel free to spend the night camping, or head back down to McLeod Ganj.
